SSL Setup
=========

The openssl packages are installed via the devshop ansible playbooks.

The packages required are openssl and mod_ssl (only on RedHat)

Setting up SSL for sites is handled by aegir.

For instructions on enabling SSL for your devshop site, see http://community.aegirproject.org/content/content/administrator/post-install-configuration/using-ssl
