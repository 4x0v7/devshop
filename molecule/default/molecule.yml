  name: galaxy

  # Set 'ansible-galaxy install' command line options
  options:

    # Turn off '--force' option so 'ansible-galaxy' doesn't re-download the files every time you run 'molecule'.

    # The 'ansible-galaxy' command considers the pre-existence of a role's folder an "error".
    # That command and 'molecule' will exit with failure if this flag and '--force' is not set.
    # This setup sets 'ignore-errors' to 'false' when run in Travis to make sure that automated tests will catch problems,
    # but it defaults to 'true' so it runs quickly for local developers.
