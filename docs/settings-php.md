Using Settings.php with DevShop & Aegir
=======================================

Background
----------

### "Sites Folder"

Aegir was designed around multi-site.  Because of this, it always uses
the domain-specific "sites folder" for settings, files and backups.

    ```
    sites/dev.myproject.mydevshopserver.com/settings.php
    sites/dev.myproject.mydevshopserver.com/files
    ```

Be aware that the `sites/default/settings.php` file is *not used* at all.

### Settings.php is a Template

Do not write changes directly to your site's settings.php file.

If you open it, you will notice at the top: 


Settings.php includes
---------------------

To allow users to make customizations to settings.php, aegir and devshop 
include certain files from elsewhere. 

To see exactly what files are included, you can open a working settings.php file for a working environment.

Possible include files:

 - sites/all/settings.devshop.php
 - sites/default/settings.devshop.php
 - sites/ENVIRONMENT.PROJECT.DEVMASTER-HOSTNAME/local.settings.php
    
```
<?php

   # Include devshop environment configuration settings, if there is any.
    if (file_exists(__DIR__ . '/../all/settings.devshop.php')) {
      include_once(__DIR__ . '/../all/settings.devshop.php');
    }
  
    if (file_exists(__DIR__ . '/../default/settings.devshop.php')) {
      include_once(__DIR__ . '/../default/settings.devshop.php');
    }

    # Additional host wide configuration settings. Useful for safely specifying configuration settings.
    if (is_readable('/var/aegir/config/includes/global.inc')) {
      include_once('/var/aegir/config/includes/global.inc');
    }
    
    # Additional site configuration settings.
    if (is_readable('/var/aegir/devmaster-0.x/sites/ENVIRONMENT.PROJECT.DEVMASTER-HOSTNAME/local.settings.php')) {
      include_once('/var/aegir/devmaster-0.x/sites/ENVIRONMENT.PROJECT.DEVMASTER-HOSTNAME/local.settings.php');
    }
    
?>
```

### Remote Servers

If you are using Remote Servers to host your sites, please be aware of the Verify/RSYNC System.

All code is stored on the server_master, and is copied to remote servers via RSYNC during the `provision-verify` command.

This Rsync will also *delete* files if they are removed from server_master.

When modifying settings.php using these includes, do so on the server_master server (or in your git repository.).  Then, **Verify** the environment. The **Verify** task will copy the custom settings to remote server.
