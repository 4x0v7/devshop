Password Protecting Sites
=========================

DevShop allows you to password protect your sites with an "HTTP Password".
 
This prevents anyone (including search engines) from accessing any page unless they know the password.
 
Adding a Password to an Environment
-----------------------------------

To add a HTTP Password to an environment:

1. Visit the Project Dashboard.
2. Click an environment's *Gear* icon.
3. Click *Environment Settings*.
4. Scroll toward the bottom of the form.
5. Look for the section *HTTP Basic Authentication*.
6. Enter a username and password, and a message if you wish.
7. Click "Save".
8. Wait for the environment to complete verification.
9. Visit the site and confirm that the browser asks you for a username and password.

Removing a Password from an Environment
---------------------------------------

To remove the password, simply empty the "username" and "password" fields from the environment settings form.
