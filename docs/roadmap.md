## 1.0.0
### Sometime near Drupal 8 release

We will release 1.0.0 when we have completed the move to Aegir 3 and can successfully host Drupal 8 sites.

DevMaster: Drupal 7
Drush 7
Hosts Drupal 8 sites


## 2.x.y
### Symfony

Ideally, Aegir 4 will be Symfony components with a Drupal 8 front-end.

DevShop 2 would be a flavor of that.

My hope is for Aegir 4 and DevShop 2 to be completely server and app agnostic.
