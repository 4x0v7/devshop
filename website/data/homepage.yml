             DevShop is an **Open Source DevOps Framework** and a
             set of reusable **components** designed to improve the web development, testing, and
             server management process, especially for [Drupal](https://drupal.org) websites.
<p>
             The goal of DevShop is to provide a complete **web development & testing pipeline** out of the
             box, while empowering users to choose their own server infrastructure and systems
             architecture.
<p>
             DevShop uses Ansible & Ansible Galaxy for server configuration, Symfony
             Console for command line tools, and Drupal for the web interface."

      - DevShop is a **Server Management System** that lets you track your server inventory and configure them from a central web interface.

      - Set up your servers with the included [Ansible Roles](https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop/tree/1.x/roles) or add your own, using Drupal as the [Ansible Inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html) for your own cloud.

      - Edit a server's configuration as easily as you edit your website's content, in a simple web interface using basic Yaml syntax.

      - Launch, configure and destroy new servers using the DevShop web interface and your favorite cloud provider.
