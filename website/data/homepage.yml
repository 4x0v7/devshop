             DevShop is an **Open Source DevOps Framework** and a
             set of reusable **components** designed to improve the web development, testing, and
             server management process, especially for [Drupal](https://drupal.org) websites.
<p>
             The goal of DevShop is to provide a complete **web development & testing pipeline** out of the
             box, while empowering users to choose their own server infrastructure and systems
             architecture.
<p>
             DevShop uses Ansible & Ansible Galaxy for server configuration, Symfony
             Console for command line tools, and Drupal for the web interface."
