### DevShop Cloud

*In Progress:* Branch `devshop-cloud` 

- Provisions servers with cloud hosting providers: DigitalOcean, SoftLayer, AWS, Rackspace 

See `devshop-cloud` branch of [opendevshop/devmaster](https://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster/tree/devshop-cloud/modules/devshop/devshop_cloud) repo.

## 2.x
### Drupal 8 & Symfony

Ideally, Aegir 4 will be Symfony components with a Drupal 8 front-end.

DevShop 2 would be a flavor of that.

My hope is for Aegir 4 and DevShop 2 to be completely server and app agnostic.
